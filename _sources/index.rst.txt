The When Automation Tool
========================

This document describes the new version of **When**, a Python-based automation tool for the desktop. This version, instead of incorporating the scheduler, relies on the `whenever <https://github.com/almostearthling/whenever>`_ core, which focuses on reliability and lightweightness, while trying to achieve a good performance even when running at low priority. In this sense, **When** acts as a *wrapper* for **whenever**, both providing a simple interface for configuration and an easy way to control the scheduler via an icon sitting in the tray area of your desktop. This version of **When** aims at being cross-platform, dynamically providing access to the features of **whenever** that are supported on the host environment.

`When <https://github.com/almostearthling/when-command>`_ development is hosted on GitHub.
