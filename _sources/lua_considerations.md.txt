# Some Considerations on Lua

The embedded _Lua_ interpreter in **whenever** is surely a powerful feature, that can efficiently replace OS commands and scripts for many purposes, sometimes also in a way that is

* more portable across systems, as the _Lua_ interpreter is the same on all systems, as well as its standard library that provides many actions usually available via different commands on different operating systems,
* significantly faster, because the interpreter is already in memory when it is instantiated by **whenever** and there are no shells and no external commands to be launched.

The current version of **When** supports a [_tool_](cli.md#toolbox) to install a script or a library, so that it can be `require`d from the embedded interpreter in **whenever**: the `--install-lua` (or `--upgrade-lua` for upgrades) command, followed by a file name can be used and, if the file type is supported, it will be copied to an appropriate directory in [_APPDATA_](appdata.md) which is in the searched _paths_. The supported file types are:

* _.lua_ (_Lua_ scripts): obviously _Lua_ source files that can define functions, initialize or update tables, and so on,
* _.zip_ (ZIP archives): the zip contents, which are expected to be a tree of _Lua_ source files and possibly binary modules, are extracted in a directory with the same name of the ZIP file in the _Lua_ subdirectory of _APPDATA_.

There is no support for _Lua C (binary) modules_: the reason is that the interpreter embedded in **whenever** only operates in _safe_ mode, which in turn disables dynamic loading of extenal binary libraries, which in fact _Lua C modules_ are. Attempts to `require` a binary module, even if available in the correct directory, will result in a _module not found_ runtime error for the embedded interpreter.

The syntax for the `--install-lua` tool is the following:

```shell
when tool --install-lua path/to/module.lua      # for single Lua files
when tool --install-lua path/to/module.zip      # for ZIP packed modules
```

and for `--upgrade-lua` is absolutely identical. _path/to/module.lua_ and _path/to/module.zip_ can be either relative or absolute.

At the moment no real _package management_ is available, mainly because the most popular _Lua_ package managers rely on development tools which are not always expected to be available on the host platform.

```{attention}
The _Lua_ library installation tool is in its very early development stage, and for the moment does not support removal for installed modules. To remove a module, it has to be manually deleted from the _Lua_ subdirectory in _APPDATA_. For updates, the `--upgrade-lua` tool is available, which removes the destination prior to installing the module: this only works if the module to upgrade already exists and fails otherwise. This is intentional, because some modules might be required by tasks or conditions used by **When**, and the upgrade tool will refuse anyways to overwrite them.
```

If a _pure Lua_ module is available as a directory structure, it is easy to produce a ZIP file that can be used with the `--install-lua` tool: most modern file managers offer a _"Archive/Compress to ZIP"_ option using a mouse click on a folder, which can be used with the folder containing the desired module. The resulting ZIP file is suitable for installation using the tool.
