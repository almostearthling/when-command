# Localization

Localization of **When** is an ongoing task: the appplication tries to start in a localized version if there is an available valid translation for the current language. If not, it just falls back to the standard english version. Only UI and CLI elements are translated: of course the generated [configuration file](configfile.md) is the same in all supported locales, as **whenever** does not expect any translated format.

Currently supported languages are:

* English (US, default)
* Italian
* ...

and other languages may add up in the future. Some UI/CLI elements or messages may appear untranslated, in case a translation is still lacking.

Localization can be inhibited: to do so, the `WHEN_APP_USELOCALE` environment variable must be set to `no`. Otherwise, even if the variable is not set, **When** will try to start in the current language.
