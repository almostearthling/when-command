# Application Data Directory

The _application data_ directory, mostly referred to in this documentation as _APPDATA_ (from the name of the environment variable that, on _Windows_, determines its position within the user home directory), is where all persistent data common to **When**, **whenever**, and **whenever_tray** is kept. Its actual location depends on the host platform:

* `~/.whenever` on Linux
* `%APPDATA%\Whenever` on Windows
* `~/Library/Application Support/.whenever` on Mac.

Logs and configuration files can be found in this directory.

When launching the resident wrapper, the following parameter can be specified on the command line:

- `-D`/`--dir-appdata` _PATH_: specify the application data and configuration directory

However, it is recommended _not_ to specify a custom _APPDATA_ directory unless really needed, because by default both **When** and **whenever_tray** use this directory to locate the scheduler configuration file -- that is, the one generated by **When** in configuration mode.
