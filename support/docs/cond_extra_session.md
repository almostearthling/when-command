# Extra Items: Session Related

## Tasks

The following are simple session related tasks, useful for closing or locking a session:

* **Lock Session**: locks the session and waits for credentials, but all applications remain open.
* **Log Off**: closes all open applications and _exits_ the current session, opening the login screen.
* **Hybernate**: (_Windows only_) takes the workstation into hybernated state, without closing any application.
* **Shutdown**: closes all open applications and _powers off_ the workstation.
* **Reboot**: closes all open applications and _restarts_ the workstation.

These tasks do not require any extra parameter.
