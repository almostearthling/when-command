This utility uses the beautiful [ttkbootstrap](https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap) theme extension for _tkinter_, which provides a modern look consistent on all supported platform (and which is probably more clean and clear than it used to be in the GTK days). Also, [chlorophyll](https://github.com/rdbende/chlorophyll) is used to display and edit code and structured text, providing a more pleasant and up to date UI, and [pystray](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray) to implement the system tray interface.
