The clock [icon](http://www.graphicsfuel.com/2012/08/alarm-clock-icon-psd/) used for the application logo has been created by Rafi and is available at [GraphicsFuel](http://www.graphicsfuel.com/). The [Alarm Clock](https://icons8.com/icon/13026/alarm-clock) icon can be found on [Icons8](https://icons8.com/). All other icons used in the user interface are from the [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) kindly provided by [Pictogramers](https://pictogrammers.com/).

This utility uses the beautiful [ttkbootstrap](https://github.com/israel-dryer/ttkbootstrap) theme extension for _tkinter_, which provides a modern look consistent on all supported platform (and which is probably more clean and clear than it used to be in the GTK days). Also, [chlorophyll](https://github.com/rdbende/chlorophyll) is used to display and edit code and structured text, providing a more pleasant and up to date UI, and [pystray](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray) to implement the system tray interface.
